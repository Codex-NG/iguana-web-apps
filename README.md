iguana-web-apps
===============

This the original repository we used with the Channel Manager application that we introduced with Iguana 5.6.

Iguana 6.0 supercedes this functionality with the built in ability to export and import to GIT repositories so this is now legacy.  The channels in here have however been ported over to a new set of repositories which are accessible to Iguana 6.0's built in channel import and export functionality.
