iguana-web-apps
===============

This the original repository we used with the Channel Manager application that we introduced with Iguana 5.6.

Iguana 6.0 supercedes this functionality with the built in ability to export and import to GIT repositories so this is now legacy.  The channels in here have however been ported over to a new set of repositories which are accessible to Iguana 6.0's built in channel import and export functionality.

Trying to import channels from this repository into Iguana 6 directly will not work.

There is a modified version of the channel manager in the Iguana-Apps repository which will allow you to load channels you have saved using the channel manager into Iguana 6.

https://github.com/interfaceware/iguana-apps

That repo has the various web apps that are in this repository.  Other channels have been put into different spots based on their categories:

 * https://github.com/interfaceware/iguana-adaptors - Adaptors to various systems.
 * https://github.com/interfaceware/iguana-templates - Templates for various channels like a random ADT generator
 * https://github.com/interfaceware/iguana-tools - Examples of various useful modules with Iguana
