   description="The channel manager application really has been superseded by Iguana 6&apos;s built in ability to import and export channels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But if you used Iguana 5 and the channel manager to save channels then you need something to load that format back into Iguana.  So that is the reason for having this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is really just intended to allow you to migrate existing channels, so I think it works."
